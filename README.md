# A/B Testing: A New Menu Launch 

## Background
Round Roasters is an upscale coffee chain with locations in the western US. The new management team believes that a television advertising campaign is crucial to drive people into the stores with the new offerings-gourmet sandwiches to the menu, along with limited wine offerings

To minimize risk, the management team decides to test the changes in two cities with new television advertising. Denver and Chicago cities were chosen to participate in this test because the stores in these two cities (or markets) perform similarly to all stores across the entire chain of stores; performance in these two markets would be a good proxy to predict how well the updated menu performs.

The test ran for a period of 12 weeks (2016-April-29 to 2016-July-21) where five stores in each of the test markets offered the updated menu along with television advertising. The comparative period is 2015-April-29 to 2015-July-21.

## Objectives
As a data analyst, my role is to analyze the results of the experiment to determine whether the menu changes should be applied to all stores. The predicted impact to profitability should be enough to justify the increased marketing budget: at least 18% increase in profit growth compared to the comparative period while compared to the control stores; otherwise known as incremental lift. In the data, profit is represented in the gross_margin variable.

## Datasets
- Transaction data for all stores from 2015 January 21 to 2016 August 18
- A listing of all Round Roasters stores
- A listing of the 10 stores (5 in each market) that were used as test markets
